\begin{questions}
    \question You will find online a detailed study report on \href{https://ai100.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj18871/files/media/file/AI100Report_MT_10.pdf}{The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence} published by Stanford University.
    This study was conducted by a standing committee that involved renowned scientists in the field of AI who have provided their insiders' perspective on twelve different study questions. You are required to go over this report and express your opinion on the following questions:
    \begin{parts}
        \part Which event, in the history of AI, has been the most ground-breaking?
        \begin{solution}
            \textbf{Language Processing} is arguably the most ground-breaking area of Artificial Intelligence. Although learning meanings and facts may seem simple enough but in the context of Language Processing they are just a small part of the puzzel, understanding grammar and the context in which the words are used
            are the bigger chunk of the problem as texts from different times have different context for the same set of words which makes it even more difficult to achieve high level of proficiency in this field. However, the models we have today are far from being perfect, yet it is amazing how far we have come.
        \end{solution}

        \part What are the most promising opportunities for AI?
        \begin{solution}
            abc
        \end{solution}
        \part What are the most pressing dangers of AI?
        \begin{solution}
            abc
        \end{solution}
        \part How much have we progressed in understanding the key mysteries of human
        Intelligence?
        \begin{solution}
            abc
        \end{solution}
        \part How do you see AI transforming the society in positive or negative ways?
        Discuss.
        \begin{solution}
            abc
        \end{solution}
    \end{parts}

    \question
    Do some research to familiarize yourself with prominent scientists in the history of AI.
    You are required to describe the role of any four of the following scientists and their key contribution in
    pioneering the field.
    \begin{parts}
        \part Alan Turing
        \begin{solution}
            abc
        \end{solution}
        \part John McCarthy
        \begin{solution}
            abc
        \end{solution}
        \part Marvin Minsky
        \begin{solution}
            abc
        \end{solution}
        \part Raymond Kurzwell
        \begin{solution}
            abc
        \end{solution}
        \part Warren McCulloch
        \begin{solution}
            abc
        \end{solution}
        \part Judea Pearl
        \begin{solution}
            abc
        \end{solution}
    \end{parts}
